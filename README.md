Mosquito_Simulation
===================

A "bouncing-balls" type simulation for modelling the impact of introduction of a female specific dominant lethal gene to the population. Population parameters were designed to model Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in small Central American town. Mosquito death follows exponential decay; breeding occurs through opposite-gendered mosquitoes crossing over (mating) followed by egg deposition in a breeding site (the black circles) after a refractory period. Intraspecies competition occurs in the larval stages, and genotypes follow standard Mendelian inheritance. Each run of the simulation outputs a .xls file with population data at each time step.
