Mosquito Simulation
===================

A "bouncing-balls" type simulation for modelling the impact of introduction of a female specific dominant lethal gene to a mosquito population. Population parameters were designed to model Aedes aegypti mosquitos, the principal carrier of Dengue virus in Central America. Mosquito death follows exponential decay; breeding occurs through opposite-gendered mosquitoes crossing over (mating) followed by egg deposition in a breeding site (the black circles) after a refractory period. Intraspecies competition occurs in the larval stages, and genotypes follow standard Mendelian inheritance. Each run of the simulation outputs a .xls file with population data at each time step.

I developed this project in my spare time a few years ago as a way of both exercising my OOP design skills and experimenting with something I thought was neat and interesting.
